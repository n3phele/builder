This charm builds an environment of continuous integration using Jenkins to build the n3phele.

The charm automatically install Ant, Junit, openJDK, Unzip, Git, Jenkins and Jenkins CLI also clones the git repository builder where the dependencies appengine and gwt are, they are placed in / home / ubuntu. For Jenkins install the following plugins: ant, promoted-builds, mask-passwords, client-git, git, github, github-api, github-oauth, github-plugin-sqs.

The builder that is cloned from the git repository contains a file called config.xml where is the settings to create a job. The Charm creates the job based on this .xml file.

To install this charm the machine using the HP Cloud  must be of the type standard.medium, that should be added at the time of service deployment.

Example:

n3phele juju deploy -- constraints "instance-type = standard.medium"


Additional configurations:

* The url should be git :/ / ...


Create a job with the selected repository via git seen above:
